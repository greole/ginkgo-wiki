__Under construction__

Resources
---------

* A mandatory read for all new developers / contributors: [Contributing guidelines](Contributing-guidelines), still under construction (but you should read it anyway - and help completing it).
* A funny slideshow on how to [write good commit messages](https://www.slideshare.net/TarinGamberini/commit-messages-goodpractices). Most of the tools are designed around these conventions, so it will make all our lives a bit easier if everyone follows that. If you don't like cats, you can read [this](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) instead (but feel free to read both).
* If by any chance you're still not using `BasicLinOp`, [here](Updating-linear-operators-to-use-BasicLinOp---instead-of-LinOp) is how you can convert your `LinOp`-based matrix/solver/preconditioner/whatever and simplify your life.
