Objectives
----------

In this tutorial you will learn how to get more detailed performance data by attaching exploiting Ginkgo's logging capabilities, and attaching callbacks (called loggers) to linear algebra objects. You will learn about `gko::log::Stream` and `gko::log::Json` classes, as well as various events linear algebra objects emit.
