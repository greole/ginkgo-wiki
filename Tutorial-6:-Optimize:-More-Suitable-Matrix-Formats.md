Objectives
----------

In this tutorial we will optimize the main bottleneck we discovered previously - the matrix-vector product. You will learn about Ginkgo's sparse matrix formats: `gko::matrix::Coo`, `gko::matrix::Csr` and `gko::matrix::Ell`, and find out which one is the most suitable format for the Poisson matrix.
