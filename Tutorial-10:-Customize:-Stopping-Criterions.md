Objectives
----------

This tutorial will guide you through Ginkgo's support for different devices, and how we can use this API to build a custom stopping criterion, with specialized reference (sequential), parallel CPU, and GPU implementations.
You will learn about `gko::Operation` and understand `gko::Executor` in more detail.

__IDEA:__ Use [mixed precision iterative refinement](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-02465-9_39) to come up with a custom stopping criterion.
