Objectives
----------

Now that we have done all we can with a single core, we will see how to use multiple CPU cores or a GPU to reach our solution faster. Don't worry - it's easier than you think - Ginkgo was built for this! You will learn about `gko::CpuExecutor` and `gko::GpuExecutor`, as well as about some restriction and pitfalls when dealing with GPUs.
